## Welcome to Go!
Since I started my tech journey back in September 2021, I've only really understood Python. While I tried to dabble in a bit of JavaScript, I found that my personal projects often didn't really work well with it.


That's when I found out about Go. I just finished an awesome course by [TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I "Check it out!") showing me the basics of Go, and providing me enough to get started on my own. I've already begun working on a Go web app for storing web pages (more on that in a future post).


### Like Python, Not like Python
What is nice about Go, is that some of the knowledge I learned from Python can actually be used here!

Some nice things I already learned from Python:
- To get the length of something you use `len()`
- To help read big digits you use `_` between them
- To get values from a map you use brackets and quotes (ex. `car["door"]`)


However, there are now many new things I need to learn. I'm excited that Go is fast and easy to use, and fits well with my career goals.
