## Thank You Hacktoberfest

Each year an event runs called Hacktoberfest. I've never heard of it before, but now that I'm involved with coding and GitHub, I'm really enjoying what it has to offer. Just recently, I got 4 of my PRs accepted in 4 different repositories!

The concept of pull requests isn't new to me, but I've never done it in an actual open-source repository. Since there is a T-shirt (maybe even a gift box) involved in this event, I was motivated to try to learn what PRs are, and how I can begin to contribute to open source. 

Here are some of the things I did (that were encouraged by Hacktoberfest!):
-    Look up how to make a PR, and try it out in a specialized designed repo (not a spam repo, but [one designed specifically for learning](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions))
-    Find a repo that is accepting beginner contributions (quite a few of them)
-    Learn how to make a quality PR and follow the CoC of any repo

Although I've read some criticisms people have toward this event, I've found that all my PRs in repositories that could be considered full of spam material have been excluded from the event. The team behind Hacktoberfest is making sure only quality PRs count. By contributing to open-source in an event with a reward, I believe that more people will learn and perhaps even be motivated to further their skills in helping open-source projects. Motivation through rewards is, in my opinion, an excellent and wonderful way to get beginners (and veterans) to explore different projects.
