On one of the academic Discord channels I'm in, someone posted a LeetCode signup link to get a discount (I saved about $39 CAD) on a lifetime annual subscription. The only catch was that at least 5 people had to sign up. We were able to get 7!


I'm an information technology student interested in the applied side of computing (scripting, cloud, etc.), so why did I buy a LeetCode premium subscription for almost $179 CAD?

1. I'm enrolled in an algorithms class that teaches these concepts. Maybe I'll get better grades in this class if I LeetCode daily?
2. Some of our best technology companies here in NA ask the same or very similar LeetCode questions for dev roles. If I ever decide to go down this route, I'm essentially starting the interview prep today.
3. I want to challenge my logic and thinking skills.

Some people like to start a blog by saying they don't know how it's going to turn out. Some people starting to learn DSA often say they don't know how it's going to turn out. I've started to do both.
