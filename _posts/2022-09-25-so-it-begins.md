## Power comes from information

Blogging isn't my favourite thing, but as I've started to expand my tech skillset, be more interested in various tools, and constantly hear others mention how important a digit precense is for tech professionals, starting a blog is probably one of the best things one can do. 

The keep things nice and short, the purpose of this blog is two fold:
1. Have a place to record my findings and archive solutions to problems I face.
2. Share my knowledge with others who may have similiar interests or problems.

As some who primarily uses Python, I don't believe in re-inventing the wheel or making things complex. That means several things:
1. I won't post simple solutions to problems easily solved by a little Google-Fu. If I find that I'm constantly forgetting some simple solution, I might try to write a post presenting information in a hard to forget way.
2. Keep the blog non-political, non-religious, and respectful.


Note: This website isn't original. As my field of interest isn't web dev, I love to find web solutions that others are offering. All thanks goes to Chad from [chadbaldwin.net](https://chadbaldwin.net/ "His awesome blog") and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Free website hosting!"). His template provides the barebones setup needed to get started. I might migrate to a different provider eventually, or maybe this will be my home forever.
