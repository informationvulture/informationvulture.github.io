## Power comes from information

Blogging isn't my favourite thing, but as I've started to expand my tech skillset and be more interested in various tools, starting a blog is probably one of the best things one can do. Primarily, this would serve two purposes:
1. Have a place to record my findings and archive solutions to problems I face.
2. Share my knowledge with others who may have similiar interests or problems

As some who primarily uses Python, I don't believe in re-inventing the wheel or making things complex.

I won't post simple solutions to problems easily solved by a little Google-Fu, but if I find that I'm constantly forgetting some simple solution, I'll try to write a post presenting information in a hard to forget way.


Note: This website isn't original. As my field of interest isn't web dev, I love to find web solutions that others are offering. All thanks goes to Chad from <https://chadbaldwin.net/> (check them out!).
